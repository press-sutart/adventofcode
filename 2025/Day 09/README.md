# Day 9

Cool-looking problem that I am currently procrastinating because Part 2 looks like a pain to code...

## Part 1

Try to use every pair of red tiles as opposite corners and take the largest result.

Time complexity: $O(N^2)$ where $N$ is the number of red tiles in the input.

## Part 2

Work in progress.

I visualized my input using Python's `matplotlib` library. The code and the plot representing my input are given in `d09vis.py` and `plot.png` respectively. The plot certainly hints the rough location to check for the rectangle, but I'm stubborn and want to find a more general solution.
